Typhoon Parma, packing gusts of 230 kilometres (145 miles) an hour, was forecast to hit rural areas in the north of the Philippines' main island of Luzon before dawn on Saturday. Output was reduced as a result of a shortage of irrigation water following a mild winter and poor management of water resources, with catastrophic impacts on agriculture in the down river regions of the AmuDarya, the Autonomous Region of Karakalpakstan and Khorizem, but particularly the former. On April 18, a second eruption occurred, resulting in a volcanic mudflow, also referred to as a lahar. Therefore, we request all our supporters and friends to please consider donating for these emergency food relief aids for flood victims. **May 12** A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck in the afternoon during our aid distribution and multiple strong aftershocks followed.

The main types of schemes developed by SCF are shallow wells, birkas, ponds and haffir dams (earthen dams). Relief experts on the scene say unusually heavy rains during the past two months have put up to 1.8 million children and family members at risk in parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. Despite the favourable forecast for the summer (Kharif) cropping season in monsoon rains receiving areas, preliminary meteorological forecast indicates that availability of irrigation water will decline by 55 to 65 percent during the early part of Kharif season (April to June) and 16 to 26 percent in the latter part of the season (July to September) due to the cumulative effects of low rainfall seasons, including the main monsoon season.

WHO recommends that the Government take immediate action to reduce the risk of dengue transmission and mitigate the impact of the dengue epidemic. Compared to 2003 when 60,000 people were affected, the 2004 floods has had less impact on the flood prone areas compared to previous years for several reasons; in Central Kenya, there was less rain on the Aberdare Mountains which usually overflows the dams and causes severe flooding downstream. Several small aftershocks have been registered since the quake, and information received indicate there might be further strong quakes because of the massive tectonic plate movements on 26 December. Due to rains floods and landslides have caused disruption to major road communication network in Lohit, Yingkiong, Changlang, Seppa, Anini, Roing & Along district. \"The findings attributed the poor harvest to unpredictable rainfall patterns as the rains which were less than normal and sparsely distributed started late and ended early,\" she noted. The worst flooding to hit the state in nearly 50 years followed catastrophic monsoon rains in northern and northeastern India, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh that killed hundreds and left millions homeless. Most climate models also predict that India will be hit more and more by extreme rainfall events as the world continues to warm in the coming decades\", said the CSE.\n",

With the help of the American Red Cross, Mr. Fernando and his family are using a compost bin to help remove from the streets household garbage that blocks drains and causes flooding. Continuing, he said the United Nations and its partners were also pursuing ways to promote water harvesting and implement modernized irrigation facilities so communities in the region were not totally dependent on rainwater to keep crops alive during dry spells. It may be mentioned here that long range forecasts of the Indian southwest monsoon rainfall are generated by many other national and global centres which employ different prediction techniques. The availability of feed from grain and crop residues has also fallen sharply due to the drop in agricultural production, especially in rainfed areas. Last year, hundreds of people died in several avalanches following record snowfalls. The northern and eastern parts of the country received less rain in the past northeastern monsoon and expect inter monsoonal showers these days. The initial assessments indicated that nearly 15,000 people had been affected - already double the estimates made on Tuesday - with over 8,000 left without shelter and two people dead.
